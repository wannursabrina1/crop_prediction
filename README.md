#Crop Yield Prediction with Random Forest

Project Overview

This project aims to predict crop yields using a Random Forest regression model. We utilize historical data on temperature, humidity, soil moisture and other relevant factors to train the model and provide insights for agricultural decision-making.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Thorough cleaning and preparation of agricultural datasets to ensure model accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Careful selection and creation of informative features to enhance the model's predictive power.
Random Forest Implementation: Training and optimization of a Random Forest regression model for crop yield prediction.
Performance Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualization: Clear visualizations to illustrate data relationships and model results.

Dependencies
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
